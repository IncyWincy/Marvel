Today's tree is yesterday's nut that held it's ground.
A plan is a germ of a thought that lays the foundation for a building.
Dreams are thoughts too.
Thoughts are inspired by our state of mind, which in turn are influenced by the 
experiences we had or are having.
So what do we do?
We choose to have positive, great and grandiose thoughts.
And leave the rest.What will be will be.
