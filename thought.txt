Today's tree is yesterday's nut that held it's ground.
A plan is a germ of a thought that lays the foundation for a building.

Dreams are thoughts too.
Thoughts are inspired by our state of mind, which in turn are influenced by the 
experiences we had or are having.
So what do we do?
We choose to have positive, great and grandiose thoughts.
And leave the rest.What will be will be.
But how do we go about having thoughts? Won't people call me mad if I just go day dreaming
Tadaa! The technique...and no people won't call you crazy.Not that crazy people care anyway ;)

Enters.. The secret effect
The secret effect is deliberate dreaming.Dreaming with all your will and might.
Dream so hard that the universe thinks it's true.
Kinda like when the entire class of 40, writes the same wrong spelling in their essay,the teacher begins to think that they are right and she is wrong!! :D
