Today's tree is yesterday's nut that held it's ground.
A plan is a germ of a thought that lays the foundation for a building.
The secret effect is deliberate dreaming.Dreaming with all your will and might.
Dream so hard that the universe thinks it's true.
Kinda like when the entire class of 40, writes the same wrong spelling in their essay,the teacher begins to think that they are right and she is wrong!! :D
